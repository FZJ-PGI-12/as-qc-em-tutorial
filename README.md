# Autumn School Quantum Computing and Simulations for Energy Materials
## Qiskit tutorial

[![Running Test in CI](https://github.com/FZJ-PGI-12/qc-programming-tutorial/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FZJ-PGI-12/qc-programming-tutorial/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml)


This is an tutorial to get you started with the basics of quantum computation and the syntax used in Qiskit.

### Guide

We have prepared two tutorials to teach you the very basics of quantum computation as well as a simplified method of the quantum phase estimation which allows you to determine the eigenenergies of a $H_2$ molecule. You can find them in

- [T1_Quantum_circuits.ipynb](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/teaching/ws_qfe/-/blob/main/T1_Quantum_circuits.ipynb)
- [T2_Quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/teaching/ws_qfe/-/blob/main/T2_Quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb)

If you are interested in real quantum hardware you can read the nootebook

### Installation

Recommended: Use some virtual environment. E.g. [conda over miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), and create a new environment:

    conda create -n qiskit

Activate environment

    conda activate qiskit

Install required packages

    conda install pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
